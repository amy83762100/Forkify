# Forkify Project

https://forkify-portfolio.netlify.app/

Forkify is a recipe application with custom recipe uploads, which allows users to search for recipes using the Forkify API. Users can view the recipe and increase or decrease the number of servings they need and also bookmark their favorites recipes.

(Forkify is one of the projects done as part of the course - The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert! by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman).)
